# Segmen
A helper for multicycle segmented processor risk exercise solving.

TODO:

- Risk coloring, to indicate the type of risk produced.
- Algorithm improvement, by:
-   Improving used data structures, using an array to store the cycle values.
-   Bringing down the complexity of the main loop from O(n^3) to O(n).
